                                <p class="card-text">The online student management system is designed to facilitate the management of student records and marks. It allows
                                teachers to register, log in, and manage student data. Teachers can update the marks of students for different subjects.
                                Students can also register, log in, and view their marks. The system uses SQLite as the database for storing teacher and
                                student information.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Teachers are the primary users of the system. They can register by providing a unique username and password. Once
                                registered, they can log in to access the teacher dashboard. The teacher dashboard serves as a centralized hub for
                                managing student data. It displays the total number of registered students and provides a list of all students. Teachers
                                can view the details of each student, including their username and marks obtained in different subjects.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The system allows teachers to update student marks. By clicking on a student's name or ID, teachers can access the mark
                                editing page for that particular student. In the mark editing page, teachers can enter the marks for different subjects.
                                The updated marks are then saved in the database, ensuring accurate record-keeping.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Students, on the other hand, have their own login functionality. They can register for an account by providing a unique
                                username and password. Once registered, they can log in to access their individual dashboard. The student dashboard
                                provides a personalized view for each student. It displays their username and the marks they have obtained in different
                                subjects. Students can easily check their performance and track their progress over time.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">To enhance the user experience, the system includes additional pages such as a contact page and an about page. The
                                contact page provides information on how to get in touch with the system administrators or support team. The about page
                                gives a brief overview of the project, including its purpose and goals. These pages add value by providing users with
                                relevant information and fostering transparency.
                                
                                Furthermore, the system includes a "Coming Soon" page, which indicates that additional features or functionalities are
                                planned for future implementation. This hints at the system's continuous development and improvement to meet evolving
                                needs.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Overall, the online student management system simplifies the process of managing student records and marks. It
                                streamlines communication between teachers and students, provides real-time access to important information, and
                                promotes efficient record-keeping. By leveraging web technologies and user-friendly interfaces, the system aims to
                                enhance the educational experience and contribute to a more organized and effective learning environment.</p>
